## Building from Source

You can of course build your own firmware from source based on the customisations in PiFi firmware - all source code and build.config files are provided on GitHub and you can also see https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem

You can potentially get it working on other non Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5 firmware so long as the config files and package dependencies are included - support for that is not provided at the moment so itâ€™s more of a do-it-yourself effort. Support for other hardware in future is planned.

## Sharing Feedback or Reporting Issues

You can share feedback or report bugs by visiting pifi.org/feedback

There is also the PiFi community for participation - community.pifi.org

Documentation on using the firmware / app is available at docs.pifi.org (more documentation is required explaining the modifications on PiFi firmware vs regular OpenWRT but you are free to explore the source code).
