## Downloading Firmware for Raspberry Pi 4 or 5

For latest versions, see pifi.org/downloads or the GitHub releases page here - https://github.com/pifi-org/pifi-openwrt-raspberry-pi/releases

**Note: Be sure to select the correct firmware for your model (either Raspberry Pi 4 or 5)**



## Building from Source

You can of course build your own firmware from source based on the customisations in PiFi firmware - all source code and build.config files are provided on GitHub and you can also see https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem

You can potentially get it working on other non Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5 firmware so long as the config files and package dependencies are included - support for that is not provided at the moment so itâ€™s more of a do-it-yourself effort. Support for other hardware in future is planned.

## Sharing Feedback or Reporting Issues

You can share feedback or report bugs by visiting pifi.org/feedback

There is also the PiFi community for participation - community.pifi.org

Documentation on using the firmware / app is available at docs.pifi.org (more documentation is required explaining the modifications on PiFi firmware vs regular OpenWRT but you are free to explore the source code). 


**Open Source**
The world of open source is all a bit new to me and I will try to follow best practices and even try to make gradual commits rather than publishing it at once in future which will be helpful as code contributions and the evolution of the project more open. I also will document the existing firmare changes (compared with regular OpenWRT) more extensively in due course - there's a lot of work to do and this project currently has a single developer so please bear with me.
